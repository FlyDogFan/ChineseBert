# ChineseBert
This is a chinese Bert model specific for question answering. We provide two models, a large model which is a 16 layer 1024 transformer, and a small model with 8 layer and 512 hidden size. Our implementation is a different from the original paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805. And our implementation is specific for question answering.

You can refer to the interface.py for more detail.

As the torch model file is very large, you should first download it from the google driven and then put them on the root.
